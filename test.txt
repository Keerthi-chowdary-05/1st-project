great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features
Nice case I love the blue and the magnetic cover it stays on nicely protects the screen and had me a useful standing feature
but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into. i'm taking my charger back. i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free, or credit those who had to buy one
I was surprised to find it did not come with any type of charging cords so I had to purchase one and then found my Sprint HTC 3D charger is faster. I would not purchase again- 1st item I've ever not liked I've purchased from Amazon
Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing
love my kindle great video
exactly like any other usb power charger, making it unnecessary. A basic charger used for an ipod works to charge the kindle fire within 3-4 hours
kindle Bigger screen, longer battery life and faster loading...an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet. As a college student, it beats spending more on books and having to lug the extra weight on my back
